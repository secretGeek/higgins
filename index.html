<!-- The higgins slide presenter, MIT license, by Leon Bambrick, http://secretGeek.net -->
<!-- Get your own higgins from https://github.com/secretGeek/higgins/ -->
<div class='container'> <!-- slides go inside this container. -->
<!-- Put your collection of slides here... -->

<div class='slide'>

<img src='image/higgins_logo.png' alt='higgins logo' title='higgins logo' />

<p>This is higgins. It is a simple slide viewer.</p>
<p>Press space to go to the next slide.</p>
<p>(And hit F11 to go full screen)</p>
</div>

<div class='slide'>
<p>Write your slides in plain Html (or markdown).</p>
<p>You can also use the arrow keys to move forward or backward.</p>
<p>Move forward now. &raquo;</p>
</div>

<div class='slide'>
<p>Each slide is a <code>div</code> with a class of <code>slide</code>.</p>
<p>They look like this:</p>
<blockquote style='text-align:left'>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;div class='slide'&gt;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;p&gt;This is a simple slide viewer.&lt;/p&gt;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;p&gt;Press space to go to the next slide.&lt;/p&gt;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/div&gt;
</blockquote> 
</div>

<div class='slide md'>

# Or use Markdown

You can also write your slides in markdown.

Just include an "`md`" class on any slide, and it will be converted to HTML on the fly.

</div>



<div class='slide kapow'>
 <p>Add css classes to your slides<br />
 to change their colors.</p>
</div>

<div class='slide'>
 <p>You can include notes with any slide.<br />
 See that little 'n' in the top right?<br />
 click that to show the notes for a slide.</p>

<span class='notes'>
<p>Notes are shown in a smaller font as they are really for the benefit of the presenter not the audience.</p>
<p>They can be a helpful cue for what to say on each slide.</p>
<p>To include notes for a slide, just include an element (such as a span) with a class of notes. Notes are hidden by default.</p>
<p>Click the 'n' again to hide the notes. (Or just move to the next slide.)</p></span>

</div>

<div class='slide md'>

* Notes can also be written in markdown.

* Include an "`md`" class on the .notes span.

<span class='notes md'>

* this note is written in *markdown*

* higgins uses 'commonMark'

</span>
</div>


<div class='slide md'>

You can include **images** if you like that sort of thing

![chicken](image/CvO6ABYUIAEKefG.jpg)

I tend to put the images in the `image` subfolder. But it's up to you.

</div>

<div class='slide'>
<p>I built this tool for a talk at 'Brisbane Alt.net'</a>.</p>
<p>I didn't have powerpoint on my netbook, and wanted to be able to write the slides while on the bus.</p>
</div>

<div class='slide md'>

I've subsequently used it for talks at the Brisbane .net user group, WDCNZ (Web Developer Conf New Zealand) and DDD Brisbane.

I like using it. I make little improvements each time.

</div>

<div class='slide md'>

To use higgins in your own talk, just fork this repository, and edit the file 'index.html'

That's all there is to it.


</div>

<div class='slide md'>

When you're finished: 

You can make the slides available on line through the magic of 'github pages'

</div>

<div class='slide md'>


To do this, go into the settings of your repository...

![settings](image/settings.png)

Yes that one!

</div>

<div class='slide md'>

Scroll down to the section headed **GitHub Pages**

![settings](image/settings_gh.png)

Check the "master branch" and click "Save"


</div>

<div class='slide md'>

Then github will tell you the url at which you can browse your slides...

![settings](image/settings_gh1.png)


It will be:

`https://{YourUserName}.github.io/{YourProject}/`


</div>

<div class='slide md'>

I also recommend using:

 * [ZoomIt](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/zoomit.aspx) from sysinternals
    * For Zooming in and for drawing on screen.

 * [BigNote](https://github.com/secretGeek/BigNote) from [Joseph Cooney](http://jcooney.net/)
    * BigNote lets you write gigantic text on the screen.


(And one of those laser pointers would be a good thing to have also. Unless giving a talk in front of cats)

</div>

<div class='slide md'>

One more thing...

The slide number, at the top left, is a hyperlink.

It lets you deep-link into any slide.

</div>

<!-- //spare slide with notes...
<div class='slide'>
<p></p>
<span class='notes'>
<p></p>
</span>
</div>

// spare slide without notes...
<div class='slide'>
<p></p>
</div>

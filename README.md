A simple way of creating slide-decks for presentations in HTML or Markdown.

Originally created so that I could prepare presentations on my little netbook computer which doesn't have microsoft office. 5 years later, I still don't have Office installed and still prefer writing slides in Higgins to any other approach.

Performing composition and layout in plain HTML (or Markdown) is the way nature intends it to be.

## Getting started

Fork this project for any talk you need to give, then edit the file index.html to contain your slides (instead of mine)

When you make improvements to the higgins.js or higgins.css file, send them back as a pull request.
